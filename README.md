# Official Website of The AS8 Organization
The AS8 organization is a community for Bangladeshi developers to collaborate on open-source projects and connect with others. There are tons of resources on the internet, but most of the typical Bangladeshi students find it difficult to start their programming journey. We are here to help you out by providing necessary resources, mentorship, and organizing code jams, hackathons, and various kinds of events throughout the year.
